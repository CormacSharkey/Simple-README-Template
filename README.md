## About

*About: describe the project simply; why it was created, how it works and how it was created (non-technical). Anything else "about" the project can also be included.*

In my opinion, a project's README is as important as the project itself, as such it is important to get it right without being overly complicated. 

While working on projects, I found myself struggling to create a README that was structured and helpful for a reader trying to understand it. That's why I made this template!

Feel free to use this template for some or all of your projects (or none!), I compiled this from various examples and guides online, and edited it until I was happy.

## Getting Started 

*Getting Started: divided into prerequisites and installation; how to set up the project locally and instructions should be included with no details omitted, in the simplest language.*

### Prerequisites

*Prerequisites: a list of things needed to use the project and how to install them.*

- NumPy
````
pip install numpy
````

- Get a free API Key from [Example.com](example.com)

### Installation

*Installation: a list of steps to install the project locally. Be as simple as possible and include everything.*

1. Clone the repo
````
git clone https://github.com/CormacSharkey/README-Template.git
````

2. Create a `.env`

3. Add your API Key
````
API_KEY="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
````

4. Create a new Git branch to preserve the base project
````
git switch <new-branch-name>
````

## Usage

*Usage: explain how to use the project, with examples and links to documentation.*

Find more examples and explanations in the [Documentation](example.com)

## Contributions

*Contributions: detail how others may contribute if the project is open-source, or highlight top contributors.*

If you want to contribute something that makes this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. Don't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!
