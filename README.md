# README-Template

A template to simplify writing your README.

Author: CormacSharkey

## About

*This section should describe the project in simple terms and explain why it was created, and non-technically how it can be used. You can also describe how it was created, e.g. technologies used, methodologies, software practices, etc...*

In my opinion, a project's README is as important as the project itself, as such it is important to get it right without being overly complicated. 

While working on projects, I found myself struggling to create a README that was structured and helpful for a reader trying to understand it. That's why I made this template!

Feel free to use this template for some or all of your projects (or none!), I compiled this from various examples and guides online, and edited it until I was happy.

## Getting Started 

*This section should focus on how to set up your project on the reader's machine, divided up into two sections:*

1. *Prerequisites*
1. *Installation*

*Full instructions should be included with no details omitted, in the simplest language.*

### Prerequisites

*This subsection gives a list of things to do before project installation, e.g. updating packages, getting API keys, etc...*

- NumPy
````
pip install numpy
````

- [Example API Key](example.com)

### Installation

*This subsection gives a list of steps to install the project locally. Be as simple as possible and include everything.*

1. Clone the repo
````
git clone https://github.com/CormacSharkey/README-Template.git
````

2. Create a `.env`

3. Add your API Key
````
API_KEY="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
````

4. Create a new Git branch to preserve the base project
````
git switch <new-branch-name>
````

## Usage

*This section should explain how the project can be used upon installation, including applications, commands and examples to detail as much functionality as possible.*

*Add links to any documentation here too.*

Find more examples and explanations in the [Documentation](example.com)

## Contributions

*This section, if your project is open-source, should detail how others may contribute.*

*It may also be used to highlight the top contributors, or may be omitted completely if the project is not open-source.*

If you want to contribute something that makes this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. Don't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'added some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Acknowledgements

*This section should acknowledge anyone or anything you would like to credit or that helped you to create this project.*
