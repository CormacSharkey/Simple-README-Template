# Simple-README-Template

A simple template for writing a project's README.

Author: CormacSharkey

## About

*About: describe the project simply; why it was created, how it works and how it was created (non-technical).*

*Anything else "about" the project can also be included.*

In my opinion, a project's README is as important as the project itself, as such it is important to get it right without being overly complicated. 

While working on projects, I found myself struggling to create a README that was structured and helpful for a reader trying to understand it. That's why I made this template!

Feel free to use this template for some or all of your projects (or none!), I compiled this from various examples and guides online, and edited it until I was happy.

## Getting Started 

*Getting Started: divided into prerequisites and installation; how to set up the project locally and instructions should be included with no details omitted, in the simplest language.*

### Prerequisites

*Prerequisites: a list of things needed to use the project and how to install them.*

- *NumPy*
````
pip install numpy
````

- Get a free API Key from *[Example API Key](example.com)*

### Installation

*Installation: a list of steps to install the project locally. Be as simple as possible and include everything.*

1. Clone the repo
````
git clone https://github.com/CormacSharkey/README-Template.git
````

2. Create a `.env`

3. Add your API Key
````
API_KEY="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
````

4. Create a new Git branch to preserve the base project
````
git switch <new-branch-name>
````

## Usage
